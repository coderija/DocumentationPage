                <p>Git is a distributed version control system. A version Control system is a system that maintains different versions of your project when we work in a team or as an individual. (system managing changes to files) As the project progresses, new features get added to it.</p>

                <p>So, a version control system maintains all the different versions of your project for you and you can roll back to any version you want without causing any trouble to you for maintaining different versions by giving names to it like MyProject, MyProjectWithFeature1, etc.</p>

                <p>Distributed Version control system means every collaborator(any developer working on a team project)has a local repository of the project in his/her local machine unlike central where team members should have an internet connection to every time update their work to the main central repository.</p>

            <article>
                <p>It consists of four parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Working directory: The local directory where you make the actual project and make changes to it.</li>
                    
                    <li>The staging area (index): Where you first need to put your project before committing. This is used for code review by other team members.</li>
                    
                    <li>The Local Repository: Where  where you commit changes to the project before pushing them to the central repository on Github. This is what is provided by the distributed version control system. This corresponds to the .git folder in our directory.</li>
                    
                    <li>The Central Repository: This is the main project on the central server, a copy of which is with every team member as a local repository.</li>
                </ul>
